## Submission Process

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Fork the Repository

Click the "Fork" button on the [repository page](https://github.com/yourusername/prompt-sharing).

#### 2. Clone Your Fork

```bash

git checkout -b add-prompt-your-prompt-name
```

Use a descriptive branch name like `add-prompt-react-testing` or `improve-python-debug`.

#### 4. Create Your Prompt File

Create a new markdown file in the `prompts/` directory:

```bash
prompts/your-prompt-name.md
